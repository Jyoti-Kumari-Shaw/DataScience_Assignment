    "the most basic unit of object-oriented programming. Object is also identified as an instance of a Class which \n",
    "means that when a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is \n",
    "created) memory is allocated.\n",
    " for example imagine, Car as a class, with main attributes(identifying elements) such as model, price, color, and build \n",
    "year. We can create as many objects like tata,toyota,jaguar etc as we want from the Car class. All of these would be Cars but with different attributes such as model, price, color and build year."
