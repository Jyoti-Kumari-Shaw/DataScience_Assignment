    "\n",
    "ans:-The central tendency of the dataset can be found out using the three important measures namely mean, median and mode.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Mean:-The mean represents the average value of the dataset. It can be calculated as the sum of all the values in the      dataset divided by the number of values. In general, it is considered as the arithmetic mean.\n",
    "In symmetric data distribution, the mean value is located accurately at the centre. But in the skewed continuous data distribution, the extreme values in the extended tail pull the mean value away from the centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median:-Median is the middle value of the dataset in which the dataset is arranged in the ascending order or in descending order. When the dataset contains an even number of values, then the median value of the dataset can be found by taking the mean of the middle two values.\n",
    "If you have skewed distribution, the best measure of finding the central tendency is the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode:-The mode represents the frequently occurring value in the dataset. Sometimes the dataset may contain multiple modes and in some cases, it does not contain any mode at all.\n",
    "If you have categorical data, the mode is the best choice to find the central tendency."

A Venn diagram is also called a set diagram or a logic diagram showing different set operations such as the intersection of sets, union of sets and difference of sets. It is also used to depict subsets of a set."
